Looking at the MICRO II instruction set, this is a **very minimal** architecture! Let me analyze what's missing and how you'd tackle division.

## **Missing Instructions (Common in Most CPUs):**

### **Arithmetic:**
- **SUB** (Subtract) - Only has ADD
- **MUL** (Multiply) - No multiplication  
- **DIV** (Division) - No division
- **INC/DEC** (Increment/Decrement)

### **Logical Operations:**
- **AND, OR, XOR** - Only has complement (CMP)
- **Compare with memory** - CMP only complements accumulator

### **Control Flow:**
- **Conditional branches** - Only skip instructions (SNO, SNA, SZS)
- **JSR/RET** (Subroutine call/return)

### **Memory Operations:**
- **LDA** (Load) - Must use `ADD` to load from memory
- **Stack operations** (PUSH/POP)

## **Division Implementation Strategy:**

Since there's no SUB or DIV, you'd implement division using **repeated subtraction** with these techniques:

### **Method 1: Complement Addition (for subtraction)**
```assembly
# To subtract B from A: A - B = A + (~B + 1)
# Example: 20 ÷ 3 using repeated subtraction

CLR             # Clear accumulator
ADD DIVIDEND    # Load dividend (20)
STR TEMP        # Store current value

LOOP:
ADD TEMP        # Load current remainder
CMP             # Complement (bitwise NOT)
ADD 1           # Add 1 to complete two's complement  
ADD DIVISOR     # Add divisor (this subtracts it)
STR TEMP        # Store new remainder

# Check if result is negative (indicates we're done)
SNA             # Skip if non-negative
JMP DONE        # Jump to done if negative

# Increment quotient
ADD QUOTIENT    # Load current quotient
ADD 1           # Add 1
STR QUOTIENT    # Store back
JMP LOOP        # Continue

DONE:
# Quotient is in QUOTIENT, remainder needs correction
```

### **Method 2: Shift-Based Division (Powers of 2)**
```assembly
# Divide by 2^n using right shifts
# Since no right shift, simulate with left shifts and comparison

# To divide by 4 (shift right 2 positions):
CLR
ADD NUMBER      # Load number
RTR             # Rotate right once  
RTR             # Rotate right again
# Result is NUMBER ÷ 4
```

### **Method 3: Table Lookup (Small Numbers)**
```assembly
# For small divisors, use lookup tables
# Example: Division by 3 table

ORG 100
DATA 0    # 0÷3 = 0
DATA 0    # 1÷3 = 0  
DATA 0    # 2÷3 = 0
DATA 1    # 3÷3 = 1
DATA 1    # 4÷3 = 1
# ... etc
```

## **Complete Division Routine Example:**## **Why This CPU is Challenging:**

The MICRO II appears to be a **teaching processor** demonstrating the absolute minimum instruction set needed for computation. It's missing most "convenience" instructions, forcing you to build complex operations from primitives.

**Key limitations:**
- **No subtraction** - Must use two's complement addition
- **No conditional branches** - Only skip next instruction
- **No multiplication** - Must use repeated addition or shifts  
- **No comparison** - Must compute differences and test signs

## **Division Complexity:**

As you can see from the assembly code above, even simple division becomes quite complex! A `20 ÷ 3` operation requires:

- **~15 instructions** for the setup
- **~10 instructions per iteration** in the division loop  
- **6 iterations** for this example
- **Total: ~75 instructions** for one division!

## **More Practical Approaches:**

### **1. Lookup Tables (for small numbers):**
```assembly
# Division by 3 lookup table
ORG 100
DATA 0,0,0,1,1,1,2,2,2,3,3,3...  # results[i] = i÷3
```

### **2. Shift-based (powers of 2 only):**
```assembly
# Divide by 8: shift right 3 times
RTR
RTR  
RTR
```

### **3. Library routines:**
Most programs would implement division once as a subroutine and call it when needed.

## **Missing Instructions I'd Add:**

If I were designing this CPU, I'd add:
- **SUB** (subtract) - Makes arithmetic much easier
- **BRA** (branch always) - Better than JMP for relative addressing  
- **BEQ/BNE** (branch if equal/not equal) - Better than skip instructions
- **LDA** (load) - Cleaner than using ADD for loading
- **AND/OR/XOR** - Basic logical operations

This CPU really shows how much we take for granted in modern processors! Even a simple division becomes a significant programming challenge.
