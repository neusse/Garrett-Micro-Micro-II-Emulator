- `RTR` - Rotate accumulator right
- `ORS` - OR data switches into accumulator
- `NOP` - No operation
- `HLT` - Halt execution

#### Skip Instructions
- `SNO` - Skip next instruction if no overflow
- `SNA` - Skip next instruction if accumulator non-zero
- `SZS` - Skip next instruction if sign bit = 0

#### I/O Instructions
- `SFG dev` - Skip if device flag set
- `INP dev` - Input data from device
- `OUT dev` - Output data to device

### Memory Organization
- **256 words** organized in 8 pages of 32 words each
